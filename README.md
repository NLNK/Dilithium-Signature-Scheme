# Dilithium-Signature-Scheme
# This is a Post Quantum Digital Signature Scheme which is shortlisted by NIST
### Modues included in this Scheme
# 1) Key generation
# 2) Sgnature generation and
# 3) Signature verification

### Running tests and benchmarks

# If you target the Dilithium 2 /3 /5
# You can choose from dilithium.h configuration header file
# If you change any of these values, you'll need to run 'make clean' and then 'make' to compile
# Use ./run to test all the modules at a time

### Results
# This will give the benchmarking timings for each module seperatelly
# Use test.py to run each module n times to test the performance
